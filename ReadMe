Vim RC Files
=============

The .vim and .gvimrc, along with an updated version of the scheme.vim syntax
file to make vim a little more usable with Chez Scheme.

We have two hacks to the VIM source that are not part of this repository:

1. In order to act more like a traditional Vi, we added a yankleavecursor
   option that puts the cursor back after you have yanked some lines of code,
   rather then leaving it at the point that you yanked too.  I have this
   commented out in the .vimrc file.
2. In order to force VIM to default to indent by two for _all_ identifiers, we
   have essentially stripped the smarts out of lisp mode, and reversed the meaning
   of the lispwords (as noted by the !).  It now treats _all_ words as lispwords
   except those listed, which it indents so that it lines up under the first
   argument (this is useful for things like if that should work this way).
